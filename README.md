Ground-based observations around 1.4 \textmu m are normally limited by strong absorption of telluric water-vapor.
However, Dome A, Antarctica has exceptionally dry conditions that offer a unique opportunity for observations in this band.
We designed a new filter covering 1.34--1.48 \textmu m, namely $W'$, and installed it on the Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope (AIRBT) at Dome A in 2025.
With this Early Data Release (EDR), we aim to evaluate the performance of the $W'$ band at Dome A to observe objects with water-vapor features.
AIRBT comprises two identical 15 cm optical tube assemblies and two InGaAs cameras equipped with $J$ and $W'$ filters, respectively. 
This EDR covers $\thicksim 20 \ \mathrm{deg^2}$ in the Galactic plane using $\thicksim 20,000$ images in three nights.
For 2 s exposures, the 5 $\sigma$ limiting magnitudes histogram peaks at $J \thicksim 11.5$ mag (Vega) and $W' \thicksim 9.9$ mag, respectively.
The $J-W'$ vs $J-H$ color-color diagram distinguishes ultracool candidates with water-vapor-absorption features from reddened early type stars. 
Some sources show larger $\Delta W'$ than $\Delta J$ across the three nights, which we attribute to variations of their water-vapor-absorption features.
Furthermore, we find stronger water-vapor-absorption for later spectral types.
We conculude that it is efficient to search for ultracool stars and estimate their spectral subtypes using $W'$ band imaging at Dome A, where the atmosphereic transmission is high and stable.
